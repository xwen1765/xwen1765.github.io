## AI Summary

This study explores the capacity for cognitive flexibility in rhesus macaques by examining their ability to re-index object sequences based on contextual changes. Monkeys were trained to learn a sequence of five objects and tested on their ability to switch the order of non-adjacent items upon a cue indicating a change of context. Results displayed that learned sequences facilitated more rapid and accurate re-indexing, correlated with prior proficiency in the original sequences and working memory performance in related tasks. The findings challenge previous notions of cognitive limitations in nonhuman primates and suggest that such animals utilize a non-spatial cognitive map, an important consideration for understanding the neural mechanisms underlying sequence learning and manipulation.
