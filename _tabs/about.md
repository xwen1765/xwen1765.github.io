## About Xuan Wen

I am a Ph.D. candidate in Neuroscience at Vanderbilt University, deeply fascinated by the intricate workings of the brain and devoted to investigating higher cognitive functions. My research spans reinforcement learning, cognitive mapping, and the neural basis of decision-making. With a strong background in both neuroscience and computer science, I leverage computational methods to unravel the complexities of cognition. 

In Dr. Thilo Womelsdorf's lab, my work focuses on understanding adaptive behavior and learning in primates. Additionally, my research also involves developing innovative tools, such as a 3D stimuli generation toolbox, which I've made open-source for the scientific community. I'm also contributing to the development of a new software platform in Unity for animal cognition studies, pushing the boundaries of how we can study and understand animal behavior and cognition. While my collaborations across disciplines allow me to delve into cutting-edge topics like Integrated Information Theory and collective intelligence. Driven by intellectual curiosity and a passion for interdisciplinary research, I aim to contribute meaningfully to our understanding of the brain's most sophisticated processes.
